# Mobile App Setup Guide

This project has been configured with **Capacitor** to run as a native mobile app on Android and iOS.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (which you already have)
- **Android Studio** (for Android app)
- **Xcode** (for iOS app, Mac only)

## Project Structure

- `android/`: Contains the native Android project.
- `ios/`: Contains the native iOS project.
- `out/`: Contains the built web assets (generated by Next.js).

## How to Run

### 1. Sync Changes

Whenever you make changes to your Next.js code, you need to rebuild and sync:

```bash
# 1. Build the web app
npm run build

# 2. Sync changes to native projects
npx cap sync
```

### 2. Run on Android

1. Open the `android` folder in **Android Studio**.
2. Wait for Gradle to sync.
3. Connect an Android device or start an Emulator.
4. Click the **Run** button (green play icon).

Alternatively, run from command line:

```bash
npx cap run android
```

### 3. Run on iOS (Mac only)

1. Open the `ios/App` folder in **Xcode**.

    ```bash
    npx cap open ios
    ```

2. Wait for indexing to complete.
3. Select a Simulator or connected iPhone.
4. Click the **Run** button (play icon).

*Note: If you see errors about CocoaPods, ensure you have CocoaPods installed (`sudo gem install cocoapods`) and run `npx cap update ios`.*

## Important Notes

- **Images**: We disabled Next.js image optimization (`unoptimized: true`) in `next.config.mjs` because it requires a server. Standard `<img>` tags or unoptimized `next/image` will work fine.
- **Routing**: The app uses static export, so standard navigation works.
- **Data**: LocalStorage works natively on mobile, so your data persistence will continue to work!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with `pod install` on iOS:

1. Make sure you have Xcode installed.
2. Install CocoaPods: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
3. Run: `cd ios/App && pod install && cd ../..`
